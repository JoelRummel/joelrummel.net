        longDescription: `At Invoice Maker, I worked with a full-stack Agile development team to build the company's flagship web app.\
            I worked directly within the workflow of the team, meaning that I took part in two-week sprints, daily stand-up meetings,\
            and code reviews.

            As part of the Agile workflow, I elected to pick up tasks ranging from writing automated unit tests,\
            to writing major features such as components of the app's paid subscription model.
